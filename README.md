Messaging REST API Developed with Spring Boot, H2, JPA and Spring Security.

-The application is developed to be accessed from an HTTP client.

-There are two users configured. **user** and **admin**. Each one has the same password which is: **password**  .

-The application is made with the H2 database with persistence in file configuration, for simplicity reasons.

-Spring Security has been configured and following all security standards.

-In order to test it I suggest to first import the environment to Postman and then the collection. 

-The authentication of the API endpoints is with Basic Auth so two HTTP clients are needed for a smooth communication if you don't want to change credentials for each message sending request.
